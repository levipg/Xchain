# Full Node

> Just because you call something a blockchain, that doesn't mean you aren't subject to normal engineering laws.

## How to install from sources

We do support multiple versions of the rust compiler, however we recommend
to utilise the most recent stable version of the rust compiler.

1. [install rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. make sure you have cloned the submodule too: `git submodule update`
3. install: `cargo install`

Note:

* on windows, you'll need to add the `/userProfile/.cargo/bin` into the Path;
* on linux and OSX: add `${HOME}/.cargo/bin` to your `${PATH}`

This will install 2 tools:

* `xchain`: the xblockchain node;
* `jcli`: a command line tool to help you use and setup the xblockchain node;

## How To Use

In order to use xchain you need to configure your blockchain and
configure your node.

* the Genesis File is the source of truth, the configuration of the blockchain;
* the Node Configuration file is the configuration of the node (logging, peer addresses...);

### Node Configuration

Example of node config:

```
storage: "/tmp/storage"
logger:
  verbosity: 1
  format: json
rest:
  listen: "127.0.0.1:8443"
  pkcs12: "example.p12"
  prefix: "api"
peer_2_peer:
  trusted_peers: []
  public_access: "/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/8080"
  topics_of_interests:
    transactions: low
    blocks: normal
```

Fields description:

  - *bft.leaders*: public keys of the nodes.
  - *storage*: (optional) path to the storage. If omitted, the
    blockchain is stored in memory only.
  - *logger*: (optional) logger configuration,
     - *verbosity*: 0 - warning, 1 - info, 2 -debug, 3 and above - trace
     - *format*: log output format - plain or json.
  - *rest*: (optional) configuration of the rest endpoint.
     - *listen*: listen address
     - *pkcs12*: certificate file (optional)
     - *prefix*: (optional) api prefix
  - *peer_2_peer*: the P2P network settings
     - *trusted_peers*: (optional) the list of nodes to connect to in order to
       bootstrap the p2p topology (and bootstrap our local blockchain);
     - *public_address*: (optional) the address to listen from and accept connection
       from. This is the public address that will be distributed to other peers
       of the network that may find interest into participating to the blockchain
       dissemination with the node;
     - *topics_of_interests*: the different topics we are interested to hear about:
       - *transactions*: notify other peers this node is interested about Transactions
         typical setting for a non mining node: `"low"`. For a stakepool: `"high"`;
       - *blocks*: notify other peers this node is interested about new Blocs.
         typical settings for a non mining node: `"normal"`. For a stakepool: `"high"`;

### Starting the node

If you are not a leader node, then you can start the jormundandr with:

```
xchain --genesis-block block-0.bin \
  --config example.config \
  --without-leadership
```

# documentations

* [internal design](./doc/internal_design.md) of xchain
* [Starting a BFT Blockchain](./doc/starting_bft_blockchain.md)
* [Starting a Generis Praos Blockchain](#) (**under construction**)

# Extra tooling

## CLI

Building:

```
cargo build --bin jcli
```

The binary has subcommands

* [cryptographic keys](./doc/xchain_keys.md)
* [The genesis file](./doc/genesis_file.md)
* [rest](./doc/cli_rest.md) for REST API calls
* [transaction](./doc/cli_transaction.md) for offline transaction management
* [address](./doc/cli_address.md) for debugging addresses
